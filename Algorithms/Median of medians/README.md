# Median of medians

> an **approximate** (median) [selection algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_algorithm), frequently used to supply a good pivot for an exact selection algorithm, mainly the [quickselect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect), that selects the *k*th largest element of an initially unsorted array. the median of medians is an approximate median-selection algorithm that helps building an asymptotically optimal, exact general selection algorithm (especially in the sense of worst-case complexity), by producing good pivot elements.
